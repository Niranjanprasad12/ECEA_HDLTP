**Procedural Block:

Set of instructions written inside the procedural block are known as procedural statements.

initial, always, if-else,for, while are some of the examples of procedural statements...

initial -> one time execution. Multiple initial blocks inside a file will run concurrently. Mostly used in writing testbenches
always -> triggered by event expression. It can run multiple times. Used to generate clock and model sequential circuits and some combinations circuits (We will use * in the place of event expression to model the combinational circuits)

Looking more into the assignments used in the procudural blocks

We have two type
